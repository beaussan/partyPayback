Your app should now be live. To view it run
	heroku open
And you can view the logs with this command
	heroku logs --tail
After application modification, repackage it with
	./gradlew bootRepackage -x test -Pprod
And then re-deploy it with
	heroku deploy:jar --jar build/libs/*.war --app party-payback
